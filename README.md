# SACEMA smarties Repo
This repository contains all the code and resources for SACEMA's Rapid Response Team activities including assignments.

How to run the scripts:
1. Open the .Rproj file in this current directory. This should set the same relative path on all computers.
2. Go into assignment1 -> scripts
3. Run uganda_ebola_report.Rmd, which is an Rmarkdown file.
4. Press Ctrl + Shift + K to knit the file into a pdf document, which will open in a new window.
5. The pdf will also be found in the same directory as the script.
